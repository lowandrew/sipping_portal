Sipping Portal
==============

The Sipping Portal is a Django web application intended to run locally
on a computer with a direct connection to an Illumina MiSeq. 
The portal will actively monitor a designated MiSeq output folder 
and allow for any completed or in-progress run to be analyzed with 
[GenesipprV2](https://github.com/OLC-Bioinformatics/geneSipprV2).
